# Kali Linux Tutorial 
Welcome to the Kali Linux Tutorial! I'll help you by showing you how to install it and run it in VirtualBox for the first time!

# Installation Guide
1. Go to "www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines" on your preferred browser of choice.

2. Look for "VirtualBox" and click on the download icon to install the .7z file. Save it in a folder of your choice (For easy managment, I recommend saving it on an external Hard Drive.).

3. Navigate to your folder of choice and extract the .7z file. (You may have to use third party applications such as WinRar or 7-Zip to extract the file.)
4. After extracting the file, go into the folder until you see a file called "kali-linux-2025.2-virtualbox-amd64.vbox".

5. Open the file and it will automatically add Kali Linux to Oracle VirtualBox. 
6. Congratulations, you've installed Kali Linux! <img width="495" height="392" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1221a982-c8a8-44ca-b836-dc7231e91be1" />

# Run Guide
1. Double click on Kali Linux in VirtualBox.
2. The VM will power on. It may take a while as it is going through the initial boot sequence.
3. Once the VM finishes the boot sequence, it will prompt you with a username and password.
By default, the credentials will be: <br>
Username: kali <br>
Password: kali <br>
4. You have now logged into Kali Linux!
